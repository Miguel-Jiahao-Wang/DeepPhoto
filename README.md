# Usecase

Design a mobile application that allows users to do fine-grained image editing in real-time before uploading the social applications.

# Duration

This project was conducted between 2019-Nov-05 to 2019-Nov-11.

# Final Result

We finetuned and pruned the RefineNet to our use case.

Our smallest model: LightNet-MobileNet acheived 0.809 mIoU with only 13MB, which outperforms the off-the-shelf DeepLabV3 in this specific task in terms of the quality, size and inference speed.
